        <span className='italic'>'We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for.'</span>

        Dead Poets Society is a lovely timeless coming-of-age story. The protagonist is an unconventional and charismatic teacher who tells his students to seize the day and make their lives extraordinary. It can undoubtedly be acclaimed as one of the best school dramas made to date. A movie that has stood the test of time and is still recalled affectionately even today when it was released in 1989.
        <br /><br />
        Dead poets society happens in Welton Academy, a private boy's prep school in the fall of 1959 where rules and guidelines are strict and students have to abide by the conventional methods of teaching. However, things change after a former student John Keating, played by Robin Williams, arrives as an English teacher. He harnesses the power and passion of literature with his unorthodox ways of teaching to open his pupil's minds. Keating believes that words and ideas can change the world and thus pushes his students to celebrate nonconformity and freethinking.
        <br /><br />
        The movie is filled with brief quotations from Tennyson, Herrick, Whitman, and even Vachel Lindsay. One of the first extracts of poetry shared by Keating with his pupils to rush them to explore the world while they still can: 
        <br /><br />
        <span className='font-bold'>"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, Old Time is still a-flying: And this same flower that smiles today Tomorrow will be dying".</span>
        <br /><br />
        There are numerous such extracts and powerful scenes in the movie that can stir hearts and minds.
        Hearing the words, <span className='font-bold'>"Carpe diem, seize the day boys, make your lives extraordinary"</span> fills your heart with unmatched power, courage, and confidence. 
        Keatings is the teacher we all have wished for at some point in time in our lives which makes his performance even more captivating with the theme of the movie resonating with our hearts.
        <br /><br />
        The plot shifts as Keating's students start to explore freedom in their lives and break the shackles of timidity. They revive the secret club, "Dead Poets Society" which was once led by Keating himself during his days at the Academy.
        <br /><br />
        In the words of Keating himself <span className='font-bold'> 'Dead Poets were dedicated to sucking the marrow out of life.'</span> The young lads gathered at the old Indian cave and took turns reading from Thoreau, Whitman, Shelley, waiting for poetry to work its magic. <span className='italic'>They weren't just some guys, they were romantics,  who didn't just read poetry but rather let it drip through their tongues, like honey. Spirits were soared, women swooned and gods were created.</span>
        <br /><br />
        In the dramatic turn of events, one of his students Neil defies his father's orders and takes a role in the school play which leads towards a tragic end, and Keating is made the scapegoat by the school authority. Though this marks the end of Keating at the Welton Academy he and his teachings are etched in the hearts of his students forever. He succeeds in making his pupils understand that it is not just about making the right decisions for yourself but it is also about making your own mistakes.
        <br /><br />
        The movie explores the beauty of poetry and the power of freethinking. It teaches us to love freely and most importantly makes us understand that the purpose of education is not about following a proven tested method but to explore, ask questions, and think for ourselves.
