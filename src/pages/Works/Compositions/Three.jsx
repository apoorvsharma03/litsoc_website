        If there’s nothing between us,<br/>
        I wonder, if nothingness exists.<br/>
        Still ‘nothing’ has existence.<br/>
        You think in nothingness,<br/>
        You feel in nothingness,<br/>
        Who said nothing equates to emptiness<br/>
        And that emptiness is vacant.<br/>

        If the distance between you ‘and’ me is space,<br/>
        Who said this space is empty.<br/>
        You say about the space,<br/>
        The space that has stars and constellations<br/>
        The stars whom you gaze<br/>
        And the constellations those predict the fate,<br/>
        Who said there’s emptiness in nothingness.<br/>

        The moon and sea, miles apart<br/>
        Forced to wipe the distance with tides<br/>
        The nothingness therein has ‘power’,<br/>
        So does here.<br/>
        You look ahead there’s nothing, but…<br/>
        But the air that parts us<br/>
        The air that ‘you’ and I breathe.<br/>
